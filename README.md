Thsi repostory has been made for **SWE 574** group project instructed by [Professor Suzan Uskudarlı](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/tr/people/suzan.uskudarli). We are a team of 5 Software [engineering stundents](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/tr/graduate/swe) of [Boğaziçi university](http://www.boun.edu.tr). SWE 574 is an extended course for SWE 573, where all students had to individually make a platform for exchanging free services, among a community(website members). On our last semester(Spring 2022) we are supposed to add some extra features, to the website as a team.

This repository will be updated on a regular pace till the end of the semester(June 2022), when we provide a beautiful, running and error free website as our final delivary.
